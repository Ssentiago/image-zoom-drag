## BREAKING CHANGES

## Features

### Universal Image Support

The plugin now supports any SVG and IMG images, not just pre-configured diagram presets.

To enable: Image Zoom & Drag settings → Images → Presets → Enable the IMG_SVG preset

### Three Working Modes

Plugin operation is now divided into three modes:

- Integrated (classic mode as before)
- Picker (new)
- Popup (new)

### Integrated Mode
Integrated mode is where the plugin makes images interactive directly in place within the note.

Changes:
- `Toggle panel visibility` command logic changed - now toggles panel visibility for all images in the note
- Reset zoom and position with double-click/double-tap on images
- Added ``CTRL + ` `` shortcut to fold/unfold images
- Added `CTRL + ALT + F` shortcut to toggle fullscreen mode for images
- Auto-activation of images can now be disabled (Settings → Images → General → Autodetect images)
- Reorganized right-click context menu for images
- Added "Info" context menu item to display image information in a modal window
- Images can now be toggled between interactive and non-interactive states
- Added "Copy as..." and "Export as..." options to context menu
- Improved native touch event handling - now disabled at leaf level instead of individual images (Mobile)
- Better image size adaptation to actual viewport size (large images should now fit properly)
- Images now adapt to window resize
- Added tip button to images (shown during first week after plugin installation)
- Images in open notes now respond immediately to size changes in settings
- Added option to control context menu for different image types: auto-generated (diagrams) vs all others (Settings → Images → General → Context menu)


### Popup Mode
Popup mode opens images in a separate modal window.

Don't confuse with fullscreen mode:
- Popup = separate window with image copy
- Fullscreen = same image but full screen

Features:

- Open individual images or all images from a note in popup mode
    - Individual images can be opened by:
        - Right-click context menu on image (if already interactive) → `Open in popup`
        - Activate Picker mode → `Alt + Click` on image
    - All images in a note can be opened via the note toolbar button `Open view image gallery in popup window`
- Zoom and drag images within popup window
    - `Click + Drag` - change image position (dx/dy)
    - `Wheel` - change image scale
- Popup window can be closed or minimized. When minimized, it becomes a button in the bottom-right corner showing the count of open images. Opening new images in popup mode with a minimized button will add them to the existing image gallery.

### Picker Mode
Picker mode highlights all suitable images and allows switching them between popup and integrated modes.

Features:

- This mode is disabled by default. Enable it in Settings → Images → General → Enable Picker mode
- To toggle picker mode state:
    - Click the picker mode button in the left ribbon panel
    - Open command palette and search for "picker mode", activate
- When activated, all suitable images are highlighted with an accent border
- Clicking on an image (if it belongs to a note) toggles its state between interactive and non-interactive
- `Alt + Click` - switch image to popup mode

### Internationalization System

Starting with this release, the plugin supports internationalization. If you want to help translate the plugin to your native language, refer to the [documentation](docs/TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md) for additional instructions.

### Settings

Changes:
- Settings navigation logic changed. Removed the previous navbar navigation system, now using a sidebar (sidebar activation button is in the top-left corner of the plugin settings window)
- Completely reorganized settings structure: Images (subsections: General, Presets, Controls), Debug, About
- Added new help page item to the About section


### Help Guide

This release adds a built-in help guide to the plugin. If something about the plugin's features is unclear or you simply forgot keyboard shortcuts - don't hesitate to use it!

How to access:
- On first plugin startup: a notification appears in the top-right corner inviting you to explore the helper. Just click on it
- During the first week after plugin installation: all active images will have a tip button that opens a brief reference of main hotkeys available in integrated mode
- Anytime: Settings → About → Help (opens the complete guide covering all plugin features)
